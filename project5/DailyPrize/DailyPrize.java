/**
 * 
 * Input: The input contains an integer n, 1 <= n <= 5,000 on the first line - this is the number of days in the promotion.
 * Each of the next n lines contains a sequence of non-negative integers separated by whitespace. The first number on
 * each line indicates the number of forms submitted on that day, 0 <= k <= 100,000. The next k numbers specify
 * the bill amounts on the new forms entered for the daily drawing on that day. Each amount is guaranteed to be no
 * larger than 1,000,000. The total amount of all bills is no larger than 1,000,000.
 * Output: Print one number that is the sum of all the prizes that Trader Janeâ€™s pays out during the promotion followed by a
 * newline.
